# Week-5
 Oscilating Platform

- In this week's videos I learned how to rotate a gameObject using scripts.
- This moved into creating a Oscillating Platform for the player to jump onto to get to the next area of the level.
- I created a new script and used vector math to determine how my platform would behave. Allowing the designer to edit how far and how fast the platform can go. 
- I learned about how to organize my code for others to read, using Header and ToolTip attributes. 
- I learned to use a secondary collider with a trigger and a FixedUpdate in script for my character to be able to stand on the moving platform and move with it. 

Mateirals and Shaders
- I learned to create a new material and how to adjust settings of the material.
- I created a MaterialsPulse script and attached it to the Pick Up cube.
- I adjusted min and max opacity as well as opacity steps.


Prefabs
- I learned how to create a prefab and implement into my scene
- Created bonus gameobject and script to spawn after all pick ups have been picked up by Player
